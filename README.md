# DAILY_SCHED

# DETAILS
This is a daily work scheduler meant for you to put your daily tasks in by the hour.<br>
The timeblocks go from 9AM-5PM, your typical work shift.<br>
The grey color in the timeblock represents the past tasks/time, the green color in the timeblock represents the current task/time, and the red timeblock represents the future tasks/time.<br>
You can add and edit tasks to the timeblock as often as you want without worrying about the tasks deleting by accident.<br>
You are in control of adding, editing and deleting the tasks for each day.
